# GUI-Database

This is just a personal project that I've been working on Summer 2017. I had just learned myself how JDBC works, 
so I created a project where I made a GUI and made interactions with the Database so much easier. 
Now you can search for people in the Database, add and Delete them. Everything happpens just by clicking on some buttons
instead of writing a full SQL Query. :) 

let me know if you want me to upload the Database aswell :)
