# GUI-Database

## Introduction
After finishing my first year learning Object-Oriented-Programming I created a small project for myself in the
summer 2017. I had just learned myself how JDBC works, 
so I created a project where I made a GUI and made interactions with the Database so much easier. 
The user will now have the opportunity to search for people in the Database. You will also have the option of 
adding and deleting people from the Database. What's great about this is everything happens through 
the GUI, Instead of actually writing full SQL-Queries. 

## How does it work? 
As I wrote in the introduction, a lot of the interactions with the Database goes
through the GUI. I tried to create a GUI that was easy to use and to interact with. 
The user will see buttons labeled Search, Add and Delete. All the user
has to input is the right id, name and lastname of the people they want to find in
the Database. 

The whole GUI was written in Java and Swing
